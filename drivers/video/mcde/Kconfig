	  If you say Y here maximum frame buffer size is allocated and
	  used for all resolutions. If you say N here, the frame buffer is
	  reallocated when resolution is changed. This reallocation might
	  fail because of fragmented memory. Note that this memory will
	  never be deallocated, while the MCDE framebuffer is used.
