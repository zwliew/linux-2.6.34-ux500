=== Start ===
Copy the .ko files onto the board, and do insmod:

insmod caif.ko
insmod caif_loop.ko
insmod chnl_net.ko
ifconfig caif0 <your-home-address> up


=== Test Loopback on net device ===
insmod chnl_net.ko loop=yes
ifconfig caif0 192.168.0.1 up
ping -c 10 -s 1000 192.168.0.2

=== Preparing the setup.===

Make sure that the kernel is built with module support.

There are some things that need to be tweaked to get the host TTY
correctly set up to talk to the modem.
Since the CAIF stack is running in the kernel and we want to use the existing
TTY, we are installing our physical serial driver as a line discipline above
the TTY device. The TTY device used to communicate to modem must be specified
as a module parameter to caif_ser.
If the modem is using Start-of-frame-extension (STX) this must also be set as
module parameter.

$ insmod caif_ser.ko ser_ttyname=/dev/ttyS0 ser_use_stx=yes
