    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
	This Documentation describes the API's provided by the I2C controller Driver.
	Since this driver registers the transferfunction with kernel framework, there
	are only private functions in this I2C bus driver. This driver currently
	works only in master mode and does 7 bit adderssing only. There is no support
	for 10 bit addressing. Also currently only standard speed (100KHz) is supported.

    <title>Public Interface</title>
    <para>
	This I2C controller driver is SMBUS compliant. It registers it's functions
	with the kernel I2C framework. Whenever a smbus read/write request is given
	kernel forms a smbus simulation and calls our transfer function.
